## 1. User Authentication

### Objective
Provide secure user registration, login, and session management.

### Functional Requirements
- Users must be able to register with email, password, and profile details.
- Login must validate credentials and issue authentication tokens (JWT).

  - Input: `{ name, email, password, phone }`  
  - Output: `{ message, userId }`  
  - Validation:  
    - Email must be unique and valid format.  
    - Password â‰¥ 8 characters with mixed complexity.  
    - Phone number must be valid format.  
- **POST /api/auth/login**  
  - Input: `{ email, password }`  
  - Output: `{ accessToken, refreshToken }`  
  - Validation:  
    - Check credentials.  
- **POST /api/auth/logout**  
  - Input: `{ refreshToken }`  
  - Output: `{ message }`

### Performance Criteria
- Token generation < 300ms.  
- Support at least 100 concurrent login requests.  
- Session invalidation must propagate within 5 seconds.

## 2. Property Management

### Objective
Allow hosts to create, update, delete, and manage properties.

### Functional Requirements
- Hosts can list properties with details (title, description, location, price, amenities).  
- Images can be uploaded and linked to properties.  
- Properties can be updated or deactivated.  

### API Endpoints
- **POST /api/properties**  
  - Input: `{ title, description, location, price, amenities[], images[] }`  
  - Output: `{ propertyId, message }`  
  - Validation:  
    - Title, location, and price are required.  
    - Price must be a positive number.  
- **GET /api/properties/:id**  
  - Output: Property details (JSON).  
- **PUT /api/properties/:id**  
  - Input: Updated property details.  
  - Output: `{ message, updatedProperty }`  
- **DELETE /api/properties/:id**  
  - Output: `{ message }`

### Performance Criteria
- Property creation/update < 500ms.  
- Must support up to 10,000 active property listings.  
- Images stored via CDN or object storage with caching.

## 3. Booking System

### Objective
Enable users to book available properties and manage reservations.

### Functional Requirements
- Users can search for available properties by date range and location.  
- Bookings must prevent double-booking conflicts.  
- Users can view, update, and cancel reservations.  
- Payments integrated with secure payment gateway.  

### API Endpoints
- **POST /api/bookings**  
  - Input: `{ userId, propertyId, checkInDate, checkOutDate, guests }`  
  - Output: `{ bookingId, message }`  
  - Validation:  
    - Dates must be valid and in the future.  
    - Property must be available in the selected range.  
- **GET /api/bookings/:id**  
  - Output: Booking details (JSON).  
- **PUT /api/bookings/:id/cancel**  
  - Output: `{ message }`

### Performance Criteria
- Booking creation < 400ms.  
- Support 200 concurrent bookings per minute.  
- Consistency: Ensure atomic booking transactions (no double-booking).

## General Requirements
- All APIs return JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes.  
- Error responses must include `errorCode` and `errorMessage`.  
- Rate limiting: Maximum 100 requests per minute per IP.  
- Logs must capture authentication, booking, and property changes.  
- Data persistence via relational DB (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL).
